* Description

Python utility to produce *a simple graph of the dependencies between
functions* in a Python module.

This is a simple home-made project, the aim of which is to teach myself how to
do this kind of analysis, learn how to package a Python module and enjoy some
nice time coding. Note that *there are more elaborated projects already
existing* (see at the end of this README).

Disclaimer: while I try to make this code correct, there is no guarantee that
it is bug free. Use at your own risk!

** Installation

- You can clone the git repository with:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  git clone https://github.com/matthieu-bruneaux/pydep.git
  #+END_SRC
- You can then install the module with:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  sudo make install
  #+END_SRC
- To remove it, run (from the git repository folder):
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  sudo make uninstall
  #+END_SRC
  or from any folder:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  sudo pip uninstall pydep
  #+END_SRC

** Usage

- You can see the detailed usage instructions with:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  pydep -h
  #+END_SRC
- You can produce a =.dot= file (to be processed by the =dot= utility from
  =graphviz=) from a Python module with:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  pydep tests/inputFiles/exampleModule.py > deps.dot
  #+END_SRC
- A pdf or png version of the graph can then be obtained with:
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  dot -Tpdf deps.dot -o deps.pdf # pdf output
  dot -Tpng deps.dot -o deps.png # png output
  #+END_SRC

** Example output

Here is an example output:
#+BEGIN_CENTER
[[https://github.com/matthieu-bruneaux/pydep/blob/master/tests/expectedFiles/pydep.png]]
#+END_CENTER

** Makefile

A Makefile is provided, type =make= to get some summary usage information:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Makefile for the pydep Python module                   
                                                                  
Type: "make <target>" where <target> is one of the following:   
                                                                  
  test             Run the tests with coverage output             
  doc              Run Sphinx to make the docs                    
  clean            Remove generated doc, tests and pyc files      
                                                                  
You need sudo rights for the following ones:                      
                                                                  
  install          Install the module and command-line tools      
  uninstall        Uninstall the module                           
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Resources used

This project uses the =ast= built-in module from Python, about which I read
when looking at the =snakefood= project.

* Related projects

Those projects are more advanced and mature, that's probably what you want to
get if you need to analyse the dependencies in your project (disclaimer: this
is the result of a Google search, I didn't tested all of those projects
myself!). The list is not exhaustive and might miss some interesting projects:
